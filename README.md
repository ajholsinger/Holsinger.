    <p class="description">"I originally began my journey when I was 14 years old and had just found out what computer programming was. I knew almost immediately where I wanted to go and the goals I would strive for. I started by attending Central Piedmont Community College at age 17, fresh out of highschool. I found out very quickly that the standard "community college to 4 year University to Full Time Job" route wasn't for me. When I was 19, I took my "free-time hobby" of programming to a more serious level when I attended UNCC Coding Bootcamp from March 2018 to August 2018. In the program, I was able to follow a more structured learning agenda and overall experience a more challenging perspective of development than the processes I had laid out for myself. While spending a lot of time developing on a computer, I also developed a very prominent hunger and an outstanding drive to use my skills and establish a heavy name for myself in the industry. That is when my vision of Holsingerdot came to life. All partners of Holsingerdot, myself included, are 100% committed to providing the best products and the best customer experience no matter the circumstance. The only problem you will have is that you didn't reach out sooner."</p>
