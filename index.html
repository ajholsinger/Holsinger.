									<h4 class="servicesTitle">Website Touch-up</h4>
									<p>Website Touch-up is just a "touch-up" of your already launched website. This includes fixing any bugs, problems in code, changing elements within the page, and refreshing servers.</p>
									<h5 class="servicequote">"The finishing touches, or just bringing the life back."</h5>
								</div>

							<div class="serviceCard">
								<h4 class="servicesTitle">Basic Website</h4>
								<p>Basic Websites are usually 1-5 pages, and often include basic information regarding services or information. This includes a 1-5 page website design, more complex structures, optional external storage, "design focused" development. A website with a basic purpose.</p>
								<h5 class="servicequote">"A basic website with a basic purpose."</h5>
							</div>

							<div class="serviceCard">
								<h4 class="servicesTitle">Business Website</h4>
								<p>While not as complex as a full stack, not as minimal as a basic. This is for the businesses or brands in beginning phases that wouldn't need as much fire power. This includes everything from the basic site with a few differences. You can expect additional stoarge, "functionality focused" design, 10-15 pages, heavy features, and customer-oriented features. </p>
								<h5 class="servicequote">"The just-right basic business website."</h5>
							</div>

							<div class="serviceCard">
								<h4 class="servicesTitle">Full Stack Development</h4>
								<p>Full Stack is the most complex of websites. Mostly used for small businesses and startups. This includes customer login, off-site storage, custom servers, full user interaction, and much more. While delivering a professional complexity to the site, the design is nothing short of beautiful. Anything you can think of.</p>
								<h5 class="servicequote">"Absolutely the most bang for your bucks, anything you can think of with no limitation."</h5>

						<p class="col-sm-8 col-md-8 col-lg-8 description">"I originally began my journey when I was 14 years old and had just found out what computer programming was. I knew almost immediately where I wanted to go and the goals I would strive for. I started by attending Central Piedmont Community College at age 17, fresh out of highschool. I found out very quickly that the standard "community college to 4 year University to Full Time Job" route wasn't for me. When I was 19, I took my "free-time hobby" of programming to a more serious level when I attended UNCC Coding Bootcamp from March 2018 to August 2018. In the program, I was able to follow a more structured learning agenda and overall experience a more challenging perspective of development than the processes I had laid out for myself. While spending a lot of time developing on a computer, I also developed a very prominent hunger and an outstanding drive to use my skills and establish a heavy name for myself in the industry. That is when my vision of Holsingerdot came to life. All partners of Holsingerdot, myself included, are 100% committed to providing the best products and the best customer experience no matter the circumstance. The only problem you will have is that you didn't reach out sooner."</p>
