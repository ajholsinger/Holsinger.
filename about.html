          <p class="description">I originally began my journey when I was 14 years old and had just found out what computer programming was. I knew almost immediately where I wanted to go and the goals I would strive for. I made the transition from a common "free-time hobby" to a serious career path when I was 19 years old, almost 5 years later. I attended UNCC Coding Bootcamp from March 2018 to August 2018 where I was able to get a more structured learning environment and overall a more challenging course than what I had tried to lay out for myself. I also attended Central Piemont Community College for a year, but I knew very quickly that the standard community college>4 year University>Full Time Job route wasn't for me. In the beginning when I was first learning, I also adopted a new goal. I wanted to create my own personal brand from the ground up. These goals and ambitions have given me a drive and hunger to my life to bring the best possible content and the best possible customer satisfaction available to the public. The partners of Holsingerdot and myself are with you every step of the way, 24/7. The only problem you'll have is that you didn't come to me first!</p>
